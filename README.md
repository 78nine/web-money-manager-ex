====================
Money Manager Ex WebApp allow you to insert new transaction directly from every device: It only needs a browser with HTML5 and internet connection to your webserver.
Its claim is to add only a "transaction remember" with only some essential data, that will be reviewed calmly in desktop version.
All transaction will be in fact downloaded at first startup of MoneyManagerEx desktop version, opening and reviewing transactions one by one. At the same time desktop version will update account, payees and categories in WebApp to keep them in sync between them.
